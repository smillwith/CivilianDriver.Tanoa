# Civilian Driver: Tanoa

Please Note: Gameplay may be sluggish. Framerates in Georgetown are much SLOWER than other areas. As a result AI drivers are limited.

Play as a civilian taxi driver in Georgetown and pick up passengers and transport them to various locations throughout the city. Use the Info Stand at the fish docks to set a few game options.

Passengers appear at taxi stands and at some of the drop up locations. Change vehicles if you want. Passengers enter the last vehicle you were in.
